To my love:

Today's your birthday, first of all, I want to wish you a happy birthday.
I wish you happy every day and the money rolls in.

At the same time, today is also the 914th of our love. In more than two years we have experienced many things, both joy and quarrel. We also have a very lovely cat. This gives me a sense of duty, or a sense of responsibility, which urges me to work harder in order to give us a more stable and better life.

In junior high school, I always tried to sit with you, not just at school, but also at the tutor's home. When I knew that you also had class with Mr.Xu, I specially applied to Mr.Xu to adjust my time just to have classes at the same time as you. The reason was that my other course time conflicts.
In high school i still like you. Sent messages to share life with you, tried to invite you out on vacation. When we graduated, I summoned up the courage to tell you I like you for the first time, but it didn't succeed.
In college, we have been in love and separated. I still remember how excited I was the day you said 'yes' and how I lost after separated. But it's glad that we are together in the end. 

Honey, you are my motivation to work every day, I really really like you. I like the way you look bleary eyed, I like the way you laugh, I like the way you pose when you take pictures, I like the way you whisper my name, I like the way you buried in my arms. Even if you have thousands looks, i will still like you.

Honey, there is one thing you need to know, you are loved by me stably, purely, warmly and strongly.Maybe plain life doesn't make me show this often. Honey, if you want to do something, just do it bravely, and I will always support you.

I want to define a universe, which includes you and I.
I'm trying to instantiate it for building a world in real memory.
let us = new Future()

My love is deep but my letter is thin, like thousands of kisses can not tells my love.
