To my love:

Today's ur birthday, first of all, I want to wish you a happy birthday.
I wish you happy every day and the money rolls in.

At the same time, today is also the 914th of our love. But the time we met
is much longer than we fall in love. During this time, I found that I like you
more and more.

In junior high school, I always tried to sit with you, not just at school, but also
at the tutor's home. When I knew that you also had class with Mr.Xu, I specially applied to
Mr.Xu to adjust my time just to have classes at the same time as you. The reason was that 
my other course time conflicts.

In high school i still like you. Sent messages to share life with you, tried to invite you out on vacation.
When we graduated, I summoned up the courage to tell you I like you for the first time, but it didn't succeed:(.

I want to define a universe, which includes you and I.
I'm trying to instantiate it for building a world in real memory.

let us = new Future()
